    Our zarr workaround well.. works! now we need a way to make the appender work quickly... it takes too long to figure out where everything goes.

    Upon seeing the awful mess my pickling did (4 gb files) and giving my Ram a workout it is obvious that we need to take a new tact, preallocate the array and append to an output file that we can load slices of for analysis and visualization. Good luck! 
-TODO

- Analysis Code:
    - Figure out how to preallocate the arrays with NaNs:
        - DONE! Write code to save in the right spot 

        
    - DONE! Write to output and input file dynamically
        !Looks like zarr is a better way to do it
    - Run?! 

    - appender needs work, there must be a more efficient way to 
    save to our allocated arrays

- Fitting
    - Maybe try the ^-1 **(1/3) and see what happens with first 1/6th of the correlation
    - Fit better fit faster sleep better sleep faster?

    - Make maps of the images
