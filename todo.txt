- Set up intinitalizer 
for confinements
    DONE Storage for line objects
    DONE Reading a file(Csv?)
    with the data
    -

-Test confinement code- see if it
does what we think it does 
    DONE, Passed Can we initialize a bunchof skeleton lines
    - Do we then properly read a jump or not
        -Invalid value, because if they are parallel we are bonned 
    
    -Have to figure out how to check all of the lines

    -FUCKKING ANNOYING
    


- Implement line crosser
into simulation code
